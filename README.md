## What is this?

S3UI is a free, open-source, cross-platform desktop application that makes Amazon S3 feel like a local file system. It provides a dual-pane file manager — local files on one side, S3 on the other — with drag-and-drop transfers, reliable large-file handling, and built-in cost tracking.
